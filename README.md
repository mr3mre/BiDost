# BiDost
Anti-Social Media Application for people to meet each other in person

Figma Prototype can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/cNnGjPQeLhEcQXPH6QziHG/BiDost?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&viewport=222%2C170%2C0.21&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=16%3A11490).

I have done most of the Front-End development. For now, the prototype of the app can be downloaded for android devices using [this link](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/4BUYhWiEtHf7L5NqKxh12o.aab)
